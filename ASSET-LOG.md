| Decision | **modify** by Bao Xing at 2026-09-30T01:33:52+00:00 |
| Reason | Clearest wing/body shapes at 24 px; pale mist colour stands out from the ground. |
| Manual edits | keyed white bg + grey shadow; reduced 4x-supersampled; locked to the palette in Lab space (environment); 1-px outline; two figures cut with gen/figures.py; FLUX drew both frames almost the same, so frame 2 is squashed vertically to 60% to read as a wing beat |

| Reason | Bao 2026-09-29: rendered as a shaded, 3D-looking illustration instead of 2D pixel art ("不用3d就是2d像素游戏"); FLUX also ignored the 3x4 grid and drew mostly standing poses. Best identity of the batch (brass lamp with spout, satchel, long coat) - kept as the look to carry into the pixel-art prompt. |

**Prompt**

```
character model sheet of one small original courier character repeated in twelve poses, arranged in a neat grid of 3 rows and 4 columns on a plain flat white background, every pose the same character and the same size, full body, side view facing right unless noted. The character: an oversized round brass oil-lamp for a head with a glowing warm yellow glass lens, a narrow dark navy long coat, thin dark legs, a small brown leather satchel on the left hip. Style: simple flat vector shapes, thick uniform dark outline, no gradients, no texture, limited palette of warm yellow, cream, navy, brown and near-black, clean readable silhouette, video game sprite reference. Poses in reading order: front view standing; side view standing; back view standing; relaxed idle; walking with legs apart at contact; walking with legs together passing; arm thrust forward casting a beam of light; flinching backwards hurt; both arms raised cheering; radiant power pose with a large glow halo; collapsed lying on the ground with the lamp dimmed; triumphant victory pose. No text, no letters, no numbers, no labels, no watermark, no background scenery.

**Prompt**

```
16-bit pixel art video game sprite of one small original character: a courier whose head is an oversized round bright golden brass oil lamp with a glowing warm yellow glass lens and a small spout on top, wearing a long dark navy coat, thin dark legs and a small brown leather satchel on the hip. Side view facing right, walking mid-stride, front leg forward and back leg behind, legs wide apart. Full body, one single character centered, plain flat white background, crisp hard-edged square pixels, flat 2D colours, limited palette of warm yellow, cream, navy, brown and near-black, 1-pixel dark outline, no 3D rendering, no shading, no gradients, no anti-aliasing, no text, no letters, no watermark
```

**Negative prompt**

```
N/A — FLUX.1-schnell is guidance-distilled; mflux accepts no negative prompt for it. Exclusions (3D shading, gradients, text, background) are written into the positive prompt.

**Prompt**

```
16-bit pixel art video game sprite of one small original character: a courier whose head is an oversized round bright golden brass oil lamp with a glowing warm yellow glass lens and a small spout on top, wearing a long dark navy coat, thin dark legs and a small brown leather satchel on the hip. Side view facing right, arms spread wide to both sides, the lamp head blazing with bright rays of light. Full body, one single character centered, plain flat white background, crisp hard-edged square pixels, flat 2D colours, limited palette of warm yellow, cream, navy, brown and near-black, 1-pixel dark outline, no 3D rendering, no shading, no gradients, no anti-aliasing, no text, no letters, no watermark
```

**Negative prompt**

```
N/A — FLUX.1-schnell is guidance-distilled; mflux accepts no negative prompt for it. Exclusions (3D shading, gradients, text, background) are written into the positive prompt.

**Prompt**

```
gentle brighter layer to play on top of a calm night market loop, 96 bpm, warm glass bells and a soft sustained pad, simple and sparse, not busy, clean, no noise, no drums, same key, even dynamics from start to end, no intro, no ending, no vocals

| Decision | **modify** by Bao Xing at 2026-09-30T02:34:59+00:00 |

Measured: 97.5 BPM (stretch 0.99 to the MUS-01 loop), closest harmony to MUS-01 (chroma correlation 0.40), brighter than the base (centroid 769 Hz vs 337 Hz) with little hiss (2.6% above 6 kHz). |
| Manual edits | 8 bars cut on detected beats after a 1 s skip, time-stretched by 0.9897 to exactly MUS-01's 882176 frames; 0.25 s equal-power tail-into-head crossfade; normalised to -3 dBFS peak; OGG Vorbis; plays silently in sync with MUS-01 and fades in over 2 s on evolution |
